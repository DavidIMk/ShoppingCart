## SHOPPING CART

Hey, this is my sample project which are build on React and Express API. The project itself is a shopping cart application where you can select and add selected product to the cart, modify the cart, and checkout. This project also includes authentication.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm run API`

Runs the API that are used to fetch data, you should run this first before using 'npm start'.<br>

Regards,
David
